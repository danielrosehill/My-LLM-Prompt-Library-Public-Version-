# Welcome To Daniel's Prompt Library!

This repository is both a `prompt library`  *(in the sense of containing prompts that I've finished working with, for now)* as well as a prompt engineering workspace where I share my fumbling progress on prompts that I don't mind sharing with the whole world. 

For some of the most useful ones, see:

## Example Prompt

I love discovering new use-cases and prompting strategies for LLMs!

Prompting and "prompt engineering" doesn't have to be complicated. 

My favorite method for making LLMs much more useful is storing an inventory of: previous prompts; previous outputs; context-settings snippets. 

For want of a better word, I call it my LLM "Workbench" (although I'm working on a formal GUI for it, it could just as easily be a collection of markdown files in a Github repo!)

Here's a very simple use-case that (I hope) shows why storing LLM elements like prompts and outputs can come in handy in *many* ways by enabling lots of secondary purposes like using your previous prompts to improve your current ones.

The steps:

- Invest time and effort in writing a very detailed "stack research" prompt  
- Save it to your prompt library as a markdown or text file (if there's formatting that helps to show the prompt's structure, markdown is preferred)  
- Before you run it, feed it through an LLM and ask for tips to improve it

## A Big Glob Of Prompts And Outputs

## While You're Here, This Might Be Useful: GUI For Automatic Prompt Extraction

See `GUIs` for a prompt to create a simple (but functional!) Python GUI for saving and extracting prompts into a local prompt library/repository.

## System / Structure

- A **prompt workspace** for drafting prompts
- A **prompt library** for storing successful prompts for reuse
- A **prompts run** for recording *all* prompts run including those not worth committing into the prompt library
