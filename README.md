# Daniel Rosehill's LLM Prompt Library (Public Version)

![Prompting sloth](/images/banner.webp)

This repository is both a `prompt library`  (in the sense of containing prompts that I've finished working with, for now) as well as a prompt engineering workspace where I share my fumbling progress on prompts that I don't mind sharing with the whole world. 

For some of the most useful ones, see:

`favorites.md`

See `GUIs` for a prompt to create a simple (but functional!) Python GUI for saving and extracting prompts into a local prompt library/repository.
