# My ChatGPT Prompt Workspace/Library

![Prompting sloth](/images/banner.webp)

This repository is both a `prompt library`  (in the sense of containing prompts that I've finished working with, for now) as well as a prompt engineering workspace where I share my fumbling progress on prompts that I don't mind sharing with the whole world. 

For some of the most useful ones, see:

`favorites.md`

## System / Structure

- A **prompt workspace** for drafting prompts
- A **prompt library** for storing successful prompts for reuse
- A **prompts run** for recording *all* prompts run including those not worth committing into the prompt library
