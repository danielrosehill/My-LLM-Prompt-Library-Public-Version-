# Prompt To Ask LLM For Scaffolding Help

I'm building up a local prompt library for use with LLMs. It's going to be a simple repository of markdown files that I sync through Git. It's for my own use, but I would like to develop the most thorough repository possible to supporting my prompting, which spans both personal and professional needs. Please generate a Python script which I can use for the purpose of scaffolding this prompt library
