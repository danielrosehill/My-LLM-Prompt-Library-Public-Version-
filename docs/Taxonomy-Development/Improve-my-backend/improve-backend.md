# Improve (Or Help Me Build) A Backend

## Summary:

GPTs can be highly effective in suggesting taxonomies and ways to organise data (or information).

One of the usages for GPT I've found the most helpful to date is in helping me to figure out the best way to store information.

As a result of my newfound enthusiasm for creating admin areas (AKA "backends") I've been coopted into a few family projects and helping out friends here and there who new systems. 

Prompts like the examples in this folder can be very useful in getting GPT to help map out the first steps in either setting up a "first-time" backend or in migrating from a spreadsheet-based system to a database-based one.
