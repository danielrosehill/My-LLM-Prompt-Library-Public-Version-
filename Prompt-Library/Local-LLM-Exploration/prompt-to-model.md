# Prompt To Model

This prompting strategy tries to reverse engineer the process of finding a good large language model (LLM) for a specific use-case.

 Or rather: it tries to work backwards. 

 Here's the prompt that I want to run. 

 Which LLM would handle this most effectively?

 As ever, to make the results personalised to my "situation" I provide my desktop hardware context snippet.

 (See: `Context-Setting`)

Local hardware

# Prompt Text

Here's a prompt. 

I added a CSV as context. Can you recommend a good local LLM I can run on LM Studio for this task? My hardware is attached.

Prompt:

"Could you create a formatted markdown page which organises these repositories into logical groups and presents them as markdown tables. Please return raw markdown "
