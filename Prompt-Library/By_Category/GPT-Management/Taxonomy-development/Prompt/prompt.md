# Improvem my GPT management system

## Summary:

I'm currently developing a system (built on NocoDB) for recording prompts, prompt outputs, and custom GPTs. I find GPT to be very helpful in helping me to ideate ways for further improvement - such as datapoints to connect with "relationships", new fields to capture, etc. It is helping to make the system thorough and robust.

## Objetive:

## Prompt Text: 

I am currently creating a system to manage my GPT workflow.
I am storing the following in a database:

- A list of my custom GPTs (consisting of custom GPTs I have created)
- A prompt library (consisting of prompts that I have written and may wish to reuse or optimise)
- The outputs of my prompts

Please suggest the following:

- 5 tables I may wish to add to the system to best capture my workflow
- 5 new fields I may wish to add to my existing tables
