# Instruct or conversational?

If you're new to working with LLMs (especially those accessed locally) you might also be feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sheer *breadth* of models available for download (and the number of variants for each model!).

While (as ever) it's possible to simply research this on Google, I prefer using LLMs to help me understand which models serve which use-cases.

The prompt below has a very obvious answer (instructional!). But it's more intended as a teaching tool and a way to guide the explorative journey. Tweak as necessary.

# Prompt

Here's a prompt:

"Could you create a formatted markdown page which organises these repositories into logical groups and presents them as markdown tables. Please return raw markdown"

Would a conversational LLM or an instructional LLM be the better choice for this task?

Explain why.
