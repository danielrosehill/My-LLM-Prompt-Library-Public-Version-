## Use-Case

Use this prompt if you reckon you have some keys on your keyboard that could be repurposed for macros and automations.

## Prompt

My keyboard is:

`{Keyboard}`

My operating system is:

`{OS}`

My keyboard layout is:

`{keyboard-layout}`

I primarily use the following applications:

`[applications-list]`

Suggest which keys on my keyboard are the least likely to be bound to a a program that I could use and which I might be able to repurpose for macro assignments.
