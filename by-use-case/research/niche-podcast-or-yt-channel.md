title: "Prompt for finding a (niche) podcast/YouTube channel"
---

Way too frequently I am interested in obscure niche topics. I find that using very specific prompts is actually quite an effective way to find information sources about those topics, whether that's Youtube channels, podcasts, or something else. This prompt template is specifically to find a podcast or Youtube channel, but it could be very easily adapted for whatever format you like to receive information in.

## Model prompt/template

Suggest a podcast or Youtube channel exploring the emerging use cases for large language models. I'm looking for a podcast or Youtube channel which thinks imaginatively, beyond the classic use cases being explored, such as chatbots and customer support and discusses more ambitious use cases like geopolitical analysis or using LLMs for data mining. I would be particularly interested in podcasts or Youtube channels about this theme which frequently explore case studies or bring on guests which have explored these use cases in their own use. The use cases I'm thinking about aren't necessarily just personal. These might be business or enterprise use cases for LLMs also. 

For each recommendation:

-  Provide the podcast or Youtube channel name. 
-  Provide a summary of the type of content it produces. 
-  Provide an approximate subscriber or listenership count. 
-  Provide an approximate upload frequency
-  Provide a summary as to why you included it.
