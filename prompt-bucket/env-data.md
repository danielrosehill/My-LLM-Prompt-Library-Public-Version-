## GHG Emissions Data Sourcing Prompt, V2

Find {company}'s latest sustainability report - 2023 if possible.

From that report, retrieve each of the following:

- Total scope 1 emissions  
- Total scope 2 emissions  
- Total scope 3 emissions

For scope 3 emissions, you can use an additional data source.

For each, provide both the value and the measurement unit and then list the source (name, URL)

If emissions are reported on an equity-basis or an operational basis, choose the operational basis data.

If scope 2 emissions are reported on a location-based or market-based basis, choose the location-based data.

Provide the units in both a written form and their unit of measurement.

Find the product of scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and report it here as the "all scope" emissions number.

Here's an example:
