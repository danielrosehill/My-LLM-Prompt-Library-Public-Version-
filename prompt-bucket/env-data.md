---

Find {company's} latest sustainability report - 2023 if possible.

From that report, retrieve each of the following:

- Total scope 1 emissions  
- Total scope 2 emissions  
- Total scope 3 emissions

For scope 3 emissions, you can use an additional data sourc if the data isn't in the main report.

For each, provide both the value and the measurement unit and then list the source (name, URL)

Additional instructions:

If emissions are reported on an equity-basis or an operational basis, choose the operational basis data.

If scope 2 emissions are reported on a location-based or market-based basis, choose the location-based data.

Provide the units in both a written form and their unit of measurement.

Here's an example:
