# Stack Research, Deeper Prompt

## Summary:

Prompt to create a deeper evaluation list (for evaluating tech stacks although other use-cases may be possible).

This prompt was built for a very specific evaluation but could be remodelled for other purposes. 

## Objective:

Create an evaluation longlist, shortlist, and "winner" section. 

 ## Date:

11-08-24

## Iterative Improvement:

Improvements are needed in the third (final) section where more explicit wording is required to identify the "winner" according to the parameters.
